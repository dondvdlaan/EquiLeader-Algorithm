EquiLeader Algorithm

Algorithms do matter in software development. In this example, EquiLeader(with cortesy of Codelity https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/8-leader/equi_leader/), we will show the efficiency of an algorithm to find the leader
(ocurrence of > n/2) in a sequence in O(n) time complexity.

The algoritm is based on taking out of the sequence a pair of different elements, till only the leader(if a leader exists) remains.

You can find out details by reading the comments in the code.
